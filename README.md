In this study, annual US-specific antimicrobial sales were adjusted for the biomass of the major food producing species between 2016 and 2018 using the methodologies established by Food and Drug Administration (FDA), European Surveillance of Veterinary Antimicrobial Consumption (ESVAC) of the European Medicines Agency, Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) and World Organisation for Animal Health (OIE). Here we include two spradsheets for analysis described in the study:

- "Biomass adjusted sales_filled.xlsx" excel file includes the calculations for all methodologies
- "Biomass adjusted sales_blank.xlsx" excel file can be used as a template for future applications.
